<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m a passionate and goal-driven individual with a strong interest in technology and innovation. With a background in
  computer science and hands-on experience in software development, I enjoy building practical solutions to real-world
  problems. Whether it's through mobile apps, web development, or automation tools, I’m always exploring new ways to
  improve user experience and system efficiency.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked on a range of academic and personal projects, which have helped me develop strong skills
  in
  coding, problem-solving, and teamwork. I’ve also gained experience in tools like Android Studio, Firebase, and various
  programming languages including Java, Kotlin, PHP, and Python. Beyond technical skills, I’m highly organized and enjoy
  taking on leadership roles when collaborating with peers.</p>

<p>Outside of academics and tech, I enjoy learning about music, psychology, and digital creativity. I believe in
  continuous
  learning and constantly seek opportunities to grow both professionally and personally. I’m always open to new
  challenges
  and collaborations that push me to think differently and expand my skill set.</p>
